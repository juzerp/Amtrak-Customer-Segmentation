# This repository serves as a platform for showcasing coding capabilities performed for several purposes. Description for each file can be found below. 
1) Customer-Segmentation for addressing efficient marketing strategies
This file consists a code sample developed for performing clustering using unsupervised Machine learning method leveraging the K-means approach. The purpose of this code was to identify different customer segments within the data based on behavioral patterns such as recency of a customer's trip, days since their first trip, frequency of their trips. 

The code can be downloaded and viewed for reference purposes. 

2) Auto-Train related Text Analysis for Root cause Identification
   This file consists of a sample code used to connect with a AWS Redshift database and performing Text Analytics by developing a Wordcloud to identify more frequent delay reasons. The code was built in the Jupyter     Notebook framework.
